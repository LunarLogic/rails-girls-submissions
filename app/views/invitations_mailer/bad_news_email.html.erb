              Hello,
            </p>

            <p>
              We’re sorry to say that you were not accepted for this edition of the Rails Girls Kraków
              workshops. :( We got quite a lot of applications and have only <%= @available_spots %>
              spots to fill.
            </p>

            <p>
              Don’t let it discourage you though! Keep learning and keep moving forward. Stay up to
              date with other events and workshops by following
              <%= link_to nil, "https://www.facebook.com/RailsGirlsKrakow" %> and see you again soon!
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Is this final?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>We do have a waiting list</strong> which we’ll keep updating right until
                  the workshops, <strong>so keep an eye on your inbox!</strong>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  What should I do to have a better chance of being accepted next time?
                </p>
                <p>
                  We're looking for honest and personal answers that clearly state the reason why
                  you want to participate.
                </p>
              </li>

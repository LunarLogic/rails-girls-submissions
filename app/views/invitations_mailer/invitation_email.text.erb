Congratulations!
We would like to welcome you onboard of Rails Girls Kraków 2017!
Now read carefully:
Because there were so many people willing to participate, we'd love to get a confirmation from you. Please, click on the confirmation link, if you are still interested in taking part in the workshop.
<%= link_to "Confirm your invitation", submissions_confirm_invitation_url(invitation_token: @token, only_path: false) %>
The link will expire <%= @days_to_confirm %> days from now. If you don't confirm before then, we'll invite someone else from the standby list and you’ll lose your place.
To get ready for the workshop, install Ruby on Rails on the laptop you are planning to use during the workshop. This instruction should help you:  http://guides.railsgirls.com/install
We will be helping people that didn't manage to do it on Friday, but please, try doing it yourself - you'll have more time to learn other fascinating things :)

We invited a photographer. The pictures will be taken during the event and published in social media.
If you happen to be under 18 years old, please take a parental consent form with you.
Thank you again for becoming a member of Rails Girls Kraków 2017. See you in <%= @event_venue %> on <%= @event_dates %>.

If you have any questions, contact us: <%= @contact_email %>
With love,
Rails Girls Kraków Team

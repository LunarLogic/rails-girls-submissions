Hello,

We’re sorry to say that you were not accepted for this edition of the Rails Girls Kraków workshops. :(
We got quite a lot of applications and have only <%= @available_spots %> spots to fill.

Don’t let it discourage you though! Keep learning and keep moving forward. Stay up to date with
other events and workshops by following https://www.facebook.com/RailsGirlsKrakow and see you again soon!

- Is this final?
We do have a waiting list which we’ll keep updating right until the workshops, so keep an eye on
your inbox!

- What should I do to have a better chance of being accepted next time?
We're looking for honest and personal answers that clearly state the reason why you want to
participate.
